# Arduino-and-IoT
So this was a quick project I made when I realized a project is due in 2 hours(Normal Engineering Situation)

The code is a simple one, but it just goes to show how even simple codes can be transformed into good application 
if there is some knowledge of the concept and some critical thinking is applied.

The code uses an ultrasonic sensor but more accurate sensors such as LIDAR can be used.
